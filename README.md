# Sound-Event-Detection-for-Road-Safety
Accident Detection and Alert is a project that aims to detect car crashes and tire skidding events in audio recordings, 
using sound processing and machine learning techniques. The project includes scripts for extracting and visualizing temporal 
and spectral features from audio files, as well as for training and testing machine learning models for classification. 
The resulting model can be used to alert emergency services or other relevant parties in the event of an accident. 
The repository contains code, data, and documentation to reproduce the experiments and results presented in the accompanying paper.
